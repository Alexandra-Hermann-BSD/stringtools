# AHBSD Stringtools
This project is a starting project for using Composer / Packagist to manage PHP 
dependencies. 
It is a simple string manipulation library that provides various functions for string 
operations. (… to be continued…)

## Documentation
As usual for me, the documentation is in the code. Additionally, in the doc folder there is a 
[Doxygen file](doc/stringtools.doxy) that can be used to generate the documentation.
That file should be overworked to fit your needs. Best with the Doxygen GUI.
See [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) for more information.
